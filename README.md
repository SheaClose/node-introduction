## Step 8

### Summary

In this step, we will use `express.static` to serve up our `index.html` file. `express.static` takes an argument that is the folder location you want to serve when the server URL is hit in a browser. Our front-end was made using `create-react-app` which has a production ready build. We'll want to server the entire `public/build` folder.

### Instructions

* Call the `use` method on app and pass in `express.static( __dirname + '/../public/build')`.
* Add some books to your collection using Postman.
* Open up `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> server/index.js </code> </summary>

```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const bc = require( __dirname + '/controllers/books_controller');

const app = express();

app.use( bodyParser.json() );
app.use( express.static( __dirname + "/../public/build") );

const baseURL = "/api/books";
app.post(baseURL, bc.create);
app.get(baseURL, bc.read);
app.put(`${baseURL}/:id`, bc.update);
app.delete(`${baseURL}/:id`, bc.delete);

const port = 3000;
app.listen( port, () => { console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`); } );
```
